# NFC Ring Box
This project is a lock box that can unlock with a NFC ring or tag using an Ardunio Nano and a PN532.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
My first milestone Arduino nano to the servo and from the arduino to the PN532 and then adding the software to the PN532 and the arduino nano. To do this I had to find the UID for both of the NFC tags by imputing code throught the arduino. Once i got the tags from the serial monitor I implemented them into the code that was given in the instructions for the NFC tag lock box. This brings all of the components together so that when i use the PN532 to scan the NFC tag the servo turns on. I enjoyed learning the code along the way because I've never really worked with code much before. I struggled with uploading the code to the arduino chip because my computer didn't support the library but i overcame that by using a custom library.

# Starter Project
My project is called the Useless Machine. In the box there is a motor that controls the arm that pushes the door on top open to enable it to push the switch. On top of the motor there is a PCB that has the LED that turns red when the arm is going up and green when it was going down. It also has the switch shown at the top and the one that controls the LED when the arm hits it. I enjoyed soldering and I struggled with drilling the screws into the corner posts but i overcame that by drilling holes in them.
