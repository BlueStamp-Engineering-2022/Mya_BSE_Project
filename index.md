# NFC Ring Box
This project is a lock box that can unlock with a NFC ring or tag using an Ardunio Nano and a PN532. The box that is locked from the inside, and there is a sensor on the inside lid that can detect an NFC tag to open the box. The lock mechanism consists of a servo and an inside lock system.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is my modifications to my box. I decided that I wanted to add LEDs to bring the whole project together. I implimented code into the arduino that allows the LEDs to turn on when i unlock the box. Once I was done with that I wanted to make a rainbow pattern instead of just a red light so I implimented a code that would make a rainbow when the box unlocked. Once that was done I wanted the light to turn off one the rainbow pattern finished. this was the most challenging part of my project because I could not find the code that turns the LEDs off. In order to do that I had to use the .fill function so all of the lights would go to black. Once I figured it out I installed the LEDs to the box and finished up the final touches.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is putting everything together inside of the box. I need to configure everything so that the servo has enough space to move around and there is enough space to add any modifications that I need to make. I also need to instal the lock so that the box could lock and unlock. I ran into many problems trying to get the box to lock again because of the amount of tension that I put between the servo and the lock. I belive I ran into this problem because the friction that the string was creating with the lock was to much for the servo to handle. To solve this problem, I created less resistance by putting the medal piece that the string threads throught higher so it would be easier to get leverage to pull the lock back into place.

# First Milestone
My first milestone is connecting the Arduino nano to the servo and from the arduino to the PN532 and then adding the software to the PN532 and the arduino nano. To do this I had to find the UID for both of the NFC tags by imputing code throught the arduino. Once i got the tags from the serial monitor I implemented them into the code that was given in the instructions for the NFC tag lock box. This brings all of the components together so that when i use the PN532 to scan the NFC tag the servo turns on. I enjoyed learning the code along the way because I've never really worked with code much before. I struggled with uploading the code to the arduino chip because my computer didn't support the library but i overcame that by using a custom library.

# Starter Project - Useless Machine
My project is called the Useless Machine. In the box there is a motor that controls the arm that pushes the door on top open to enable it to push the switch. On top of the motor there is a PCB that has the LED that turns red when the arm is going up and green when it was going down. It also has the switch shown at the top and the one that controls the LED when the arm hits it. I enjoyed soldering and I struggled with drilling the screws into the corner posts but i overcame that by drilling holes in them.
